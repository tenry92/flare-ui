Flare UI
========

**Flare UI** is a web based **widget toolkit** using
`custom elements <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements>`_.

This toolkit adds additional HTML elements you can use, such as ``<flare-dropdown>``
or ``<flare-group-box>``.

Browser compatibility
---------------------

This widget toolkit is designed to be used in `Electron <https://www.electronjs.org/>`_,
which is **Chrome-based**.
This should make browsers based on that engine compatible, including **Microsoft Edge**
and **Opera**.

Other browsers are probably not or only partly supported.
